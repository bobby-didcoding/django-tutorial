## Getting started
First you will need to clone down the first module.

1) Create a new directory on your local machine. I have called mine django_course. This is your 'root directory'.

2) Open a terminal and cd into the root directory.

3) You can now clone the first module. You can do this a few different ways. I use SSH...

```
#option 1 - SSH
git clone --module_1 basics git@github.com:bobby-didcoding/django-tutorial.git .

#option 2 - Github CLI
gh repo clone bobby-didcoding/django-tutorial .
git checkout module_1

#option 3 - HTTPS
git clone --branch module_1 https://github.com/bobby-didcoding/django-tutorial.git .
```
